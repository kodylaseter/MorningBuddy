MorningBuddy
======
Morning Buddy is a mobile application designed to help commuters start their day off strong. Morning Buddy is a smart alarm clock, weather reporter, and calendar all in one. The smart alarm clock allows the user to enter a starting location and a destination. Then, it calculates how much time the user needs to get to his or her destination, taking into account factors such as traffic and weather. For example, the commute from a userâ€™s home to work or meeting address may normally take an hour, but if Morning Buddy detects traffic that will affect the commute, it will wake the user up a little bit earlier to account for the extra time. Additionally, Morning Buddy shares the weather report and calendar events for the day, making sure the user is prepared.
